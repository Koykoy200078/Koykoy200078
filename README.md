## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am an experienced software developer dedicated to crafting seamless mobile, web, and desktop applications. I have honed my skills in a diverse range of programming languages—including Java, Kotlin, Flutter, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, .NET, and C/C++—which, combined with my full-stack expertise in technologies like Google Cloud, ReactJS, NextJS, React Native, and PHP, enables me to produce robust and dynamic solutions.

Over the past years, I have immersed myself in self-directed learning and experimentation, complemented by a year of real-world development experience. This journey has allowed me to build a strong foundation across mobile, web, and desktop environments. My proven track record of delivering exceptional results through noteworthy personal and team-based projects is a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and adapting to new technologies and industry trends.
